```r
# Generate 5000 worlds, each simulate 20 years
returns = matrix(rnorm(n = 5000*20, mean = 6, sd = 15),
                 nrow = 5000, ncol=20)/100
total_wealth = apply(1+returns, 1, prod)
# Plotting
d = density(total_wealth)
plot(d, xlab="total wealth in $", ylab = "density",
      main = "Total wealth in 20 years", xlim = c(0,20))
